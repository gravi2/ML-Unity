# Few TODOs in this project

## Server
1. Allow switching between learning/predict mode via CLI parameter or menu option

## Client
1. Provide a UI to Switch between learn mode and auto mode
2. Currently the client seems to hang if the server communication fails. Recheck the error handling and prevent hanging/freezing of Unity/Client.
3. Restart once the ball falls down.

## Extensions/Ideas
1. Reinforcement Learning using Deep NN. ( Plot the learning in Tensorboard)
2. WebGL output communicating with a tensorflow.js model?
